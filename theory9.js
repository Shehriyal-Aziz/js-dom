// whats diff tw innertext,textcontent and innerhtml


// first come to df btw innertext and textcontent
// both are very very similar 
// but innet text(it) is old and textContent(tc)is new
// it is slower but tc is faster
// it just take value which is written but tc also takes out the value thats hidden


// now come to innerhtml (ih) 
// we use this wehn we have slected tag like div and and want to create other elements inside it
//  but the content will come through js
